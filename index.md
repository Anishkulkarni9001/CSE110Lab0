# Anish Kulkarni

Hello there, my name is Anish Kulkarni. I am currently an undergraduate student at UCSD studying Computer Engineering as a part of the ECE department. Currently, I spend my time ~~doing whatever~~ studying hard and working on my academic development. 

### As a Programmer, 
I would say that I am dedicated and capable of solving tough problems, and I occassionally practice my problem-solving using _LeetCode_ and _CodeSignal_ to try and keep myself sharp, but I'll be the first (and **only** person) to admit that I should do this more often. 

I do have a major flaw in that I am not concious of my style - much as Professor Powell described, I have been used to writing code that only I look at, meaning my style and documentation is all over the place. I am trying my best to change that, however, but it's slow going. I'm hoping this CSE 110 course can put me on the right track for the future. Lastly, I will mention that I thoroughly enjoy both Python and Java (I am aware that tools only take you so far, but convenience is also nice to have). 
```
import soul
import antigravity
print "Suck on that, C users!"
```

### As a Student, 
I think I work hard and attend class (as much as possible). I'll say I have done fairly well, but rote-learning can only cover for me so much. So, I study when possible and do all the things a regular college student should to pass my classes. So far, this has worked out for me, and I hope it continues until I graduate (ideally in three years). 
My favorite classes in order are :
1. ECE 5
2. CSE 12
3. ECE 35
4. CSE 15L
5. CSE 20

This list will likely expand and change as time goes on, and I am enthusiastic to see where CSE 110 ranks ðŸ˜„. 

### As a Person, 
I don't really know what to say. If I had to describe myself as a person, I would say that I am sarcastic, optimistic and easily excited. I have a very dry sense of humor and love anything that involves a touch of irony. For instance, the following quote makes me smile at any time. 

> This quote is very memorable - Randall Munroe

I spend much of my time in school and work (like any good college student), but in my spare time, I like reading [obscure wikipedia entries](https://www.instagram.com/depthsofwikipedia/?hl=en), occassionally practicing problem-solving (refer to the '[As a Programmer](#as-a-programmer)' section), and playing video games. 
Some of my personal favorite games (in no particular order) are :
- Hollow Knight
- Minecraft
- Binding of Isaac
- Pokemon (Any)

### In Summary,
I'd say I have covered most of what it's like to be me here. Usually, I describe myself as well-adjusted but generic - there's not many things I do exemplarily but I can do a lot of things pretty well. And, I'd say that about wraps it up -

- [x] CSE 110 Lab 1
- [ ] CSE 110 Paragraph
- [ ] ECE 100 Lab 1
- [ ] CSE 151B Lab 1

Yikes. Guess I still have a lot of work. Thank you for reading!
